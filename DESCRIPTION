Description: Two novel matching-based methods for estimating group average treatment effects (GATEs). The match_y1y0() and match_y1y0_bc() functions are used for imputing the potential outcomes based on matching and bias-corrected matching techniques, respectively. The EstGATE() function is employed to estimate the GATE after imputing the potential outcomes.
